# Remixing Your First Project

Welcome to Koji! This is the first part of a three-part tutorial for developers. If you want to learn how to download a Koji project to your local development machine, then read on. 

## Choosing a template for your project

You can find many game templates on the [Scaffolds (For Developers)](https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)?sort=remixes) page. The instructions you find below should work well with any of them. For this tutorial, I am going to use Svarog's [Element Match](https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match) template, because it features in the [How To](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7FAL2IV0sk&feature=youtu.be) video tutorial, and it illustrates a completed game with code that runs both on the backend and on the frontend.

## Starting to Remix

Visit the [Element Match](https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match) project and click on the `âˆž Remix` button. Koji's Online Editor will open.


#### Signing in

If you are not signed in, you will be asked to sign in. If you are not yet registered, you will be asked to create an account.



#### Note

For the screen shots, I have used the energy-friendly Dark Koji theme. You can change the theme by clicking on your avatar at the top right, then on the cog icon, on the radio button for the theme you want, and finally on the Save button.

I use "KojiCoder" as the username for the project, but you should use the username you gave when you registered with Koji.


## Editor Overview

The Online Editor is divided into 4 sections:

1.  A column of Links on the left
2.  An editing pane which allows multiple open tabs in the center
3.  A Preview pane on the right
4.  A collapsible Terminal pane, with multiple tabs, at the bottom

At the top of the window, you will see an editable field with the default name of your new project: `Element Match (remix)`. This name will be used to create the URL to your game, so it is a good idea to change it to something that you will be proud of now.
